# First-Java-Game
The first Java game I made following a YouTube tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gir2R7G9ws&list=RDCMUCOs7Q7IeuzgRyARaEqif75A&index=6

I'd be lying if I said I understood how every part of this project works (if it works at all...) but it did help me understand many concepts like creating Windows, Key Events, Graphics etc. I'm a huge gamer so being able to improve my coding skills through a fun, familiar avenue was a pleasure. Of course, there were parts that didn't go so well. I tried(failed) inserting a sprite sheet to give my players and enemies more personality. There's also supposed to be a sound effect whenever the user clicks the mousepad I still haven't figure it out on my own.

I make make minor tweaks in an offline version for testing purposes but for the most part I use this game as a practical features example.

Hope you find something useful :)
